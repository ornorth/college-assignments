matrotate.c and sharpen.c are not compiled. I kept them in as a reference for where I got code from.
The program takes no input but assumes the existence of directory '/tmp/cards_3x4_pgm'.
Images within that directory should follow the naming conventions of the given images.

The program still does not work and I am not entirely sure why.
I may revisit this code later and try to fix it.
