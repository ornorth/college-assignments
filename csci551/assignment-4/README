make: 
    left_float left_double trap_float trap_double
execute:
    $ mpirun -n <number of processes> -ppn <processes per node> -f c1_hosts ./<executable name> <steps per second>
example: 
    $ mpirun -n 8 -ppn 1 -f c1_hosts ./left_double 10
    '10' in the above example translates to a step size of 1/10: that is, input is steps per second, not step size

VERBOSE flag is by default turned off. Turning it on will trigger a display of which processes are integrating which segments
default output will display final position, difference from expected position, and final velocity
code was adapted from linear interpolation in Exercise 3 - code will run for any number of processes that evenly divide 1800
